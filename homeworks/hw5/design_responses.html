                            <p> I learned different ways to do transitons, the first 2 in particular had good transitions. I also learned different designs regarding when the user interacts or taps the screen. There were also some nice loading screens that gives good inspiration. </p>

                            <p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> My favorite part of this article has to be the gifs that they used to display designs. I would prefer a gif format than a video or simple an image, so this was nice. Out of all the designs, my favorite has to be Dark by 𝔅𝔢𝔰𝔱𝔖𝔢𝔯𝔳𝔢𝔡𝔅𝔬𝔩𝔡 for Green Chameleon.  </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>In 4-5 sentences, please explain which of the inspirations were your favorite, why, and how the interfaces achieved their goal in a unique/delightful manner.</p>
                            <p> The welcome screen by Andrej Radisic was one of my favorites because of its unique transition from the home to login page, the transition itself seesm to fit the overall aesthetic as well. I also liked the shopping app transitiosn by Vlad Fedoseyev due to the effects that take place when the user chooses a new color or size, for example the border effect for sizing. I liked it because it was simple yet elegant, and also made a big impact. Finally, my most favorite was Dark for Green Chameleon because I like how the background moves with the movements of the user.  </p>

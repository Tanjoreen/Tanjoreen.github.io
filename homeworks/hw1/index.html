            <li> My favorite parts of the article included the slowed down gifs that were incorporated throughout for the reader, allowing points to be made and understood more easily. My other favorite part was when the writer offered their own observations which seemed to be pretty insightful </li>
            <li> Cool quote: "When I started off in design, I sucked." </li>
            <li> On a scale of 1 to 10, I give this article a 6 in terms of enjoyment. </li>

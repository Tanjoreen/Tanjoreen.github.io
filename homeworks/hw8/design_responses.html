						<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> Prior to this article, I have never heard of the word dark patterns, and I learned that this is defined as deceptive UX/UI interactions disigned to mislead or trick. I learned that dark patterns do not exist only on the web, and we have most likely encountered it before. I learned about 11 different types of dark patterns, namely: Bait and Switch, Disguised Ads, Forced Continuity, Friend Spam, Hidden Costs, Misdirection, Price Comparison Prevention, Privacy Zuckering, Roach Motel, Sneak into Basket, Trick Questions. </p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> My favorite part was all of the pictures that they added as an example of what the writer was talking about. Not only was an image provided, the writer thoughtfully highlighted the areas that demonstrated dark patterns. Also, some of the photos were amusing so that was nice.  </p>

					<li>
						<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
						<p> "There are no easy solutions or alternatives to dark patterns." </p>
					</li>

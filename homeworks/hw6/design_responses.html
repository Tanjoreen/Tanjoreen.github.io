						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> Something interesting that I learned is that there is an actual numerical value to how fast your animations should be, and that it differs for each type of device. I learned that smaller objects compared to bigger ones move slower because they make bigger offsets and that the energy of collision must be evenly distributed. To make the movements of object appear more natural, easing should be used.  </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of this article is that it used exact science and numbers in order to convey the points that they were making. I also enjoyed the frequence incorporation of visuals after what seems to be every other paragraph. The visuals are also formatted in a very easy way to understand, with one side being a good example and another side being the bad example. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "But do not forget that animation is more of an art than science, so itâ€™s better to experiment and test your decisions on users." </p>
						</li>

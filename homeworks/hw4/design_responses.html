					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> Something that I learned was the term color accessible, as I had no idea that there was so much thought and planning that goes behind color design choices. I just simply thought that for the most part in web design, color was only considered for aesthetic reasons. I learned how to make any design more accessible: Adding enough contrast, not relying only on colors, and allowing others to reference it.  </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of the article, again, are the visual examples that the writer provides in order to convey their point more clearly. It is further easy to understand when it is formatted by a do's and don'ts way. I also like how the writer randomly inserts their own quotes into the article, I've never seen a writer quote themselves in their writing before lol. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "Not creating accessible products is just rude, so donâ€™t be rude." I found this quote to be a little amusing because of how straigthforward it was. it gives off the same vibes as saying "being poor is bad. So just don't be poor"</p>
						</li>
					</ul>

					<div class="body-header">Feedback</div>

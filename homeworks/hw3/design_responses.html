							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned that fonts can affect the degree of engagement received from your targeted audience. 
								I also learned that you should have at a maximum of three different fonts, and to make sure that each additional font does not contrast the others. 
								Finally, something interesting that I did not know before is that there are aesthetically pleasing ratios for different fonts. Although this is not stated anywhere explicity, it is kind of like an unspoken rule.

							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> Honestly, my favorite part of the articles were the images that they provided as examples to whatever point they were trying to make. 
								The images really captures the eye while simultaenously being aesthetically pleasing. 
								It demonstrates that even simple designs can make a statement and also be complex in the way different components are harmonized.
